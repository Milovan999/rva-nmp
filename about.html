        BMW M ("M" for "motorsport") was initially created to facilitate BMW's
        racing program, which was very successful in the 1960s and 1970s. As
        time passed, BMW M began to supplement BMW's vehicle portfolio with
        specially modified higher trim models, for which they are now most known
        by the general public. These M-badged cars traditionally include
        modified engines, transmissions, suspensions, interior trims,
        aerodynamics, and exterior modifications to set them apart from their
        counterparts. All M models are tested and tuned at BMW's private
        facility at the Nürburgring racing circuit in Germany.
