            The third generation of the 1 Series was released in 2019. Unlike
            the previous generation F20 1 Series, the F40 1 Series uses a
            front-wheel drive configuration with an all-wheel drive option, and
            sharing its platform with the F48 X1, F39 X2, 2 Series Gran Coupé,
            and others. The F40 1 Series is only available as a 5-door hatchback

            The second-generation 2 Series coupé was revealed in July 2021 as
            the successor to the F22 2 Series coupé and convertible. Remained a
            rear-wheel-drive-based model, the G42 is built on the CLAR platform
            with 50:50 distribution and share many mechanical components and
            engine with Series 3 G20 and Series 4 G22. Unlike its predecessor,
            the second-generation 2 Series coupé is no longer available with a
            manual transmission and not complemented with a convertible body
            style.

            The BMW 3 Series (G20) was unveiled at the 2018 Paris Motor Show on
            October 2, 2018. The official images of the vehicle were revealed a
            day prior to its unveiling. The seventh generation of the 3 Series
            is also offered as a station wagon. The more powerful M3 and M3
            Competition variants were delivered globally starting in 2021

            This generation was launched in June 2020 and is currently in
            production. The G22/G23/G26 will be produced alongside - and shares
            many features with - the G20 3 Series. As with the G20 3 Series
            range, the G22/G23/G26 will be powered by turbocharged petrol and
            diesel engines. Unlike its predecessor, the new 4 Series has a
            significant departure in design from the 3 Series in order to
            distinguish between the two models and to move the 4 Series upscale.
            The most notable of the design changes is the large kidney grille at
            the front which was inspired by the 1930s BMW 328.

            The G30 is based on the same modular platform as the 7 Series (G11).
            BMW plans to release a saloon- and estate-style plug-in hybrid, the
            530e iPerformance, which would have the advanced driver-assistance
            systems found in the 7 Series. The F90 M5 is the M5 performance
            model for the G30 generation, and is the first M5 to employ an
            all-wheel drive powertrain. It is powered by an upgraded version of
            the S63 twin-turbo V8 engine used in the previous generation F10 M5.

            The G11/G12 is the sixth generation of 7 Series, which has been in
            production since 2015. It was revealed on June 10, 2015 at BMW's
            headquarters in Munich. An official public reveal took place at the
            2015 International Motor Show Germany. G11 is the codename for the
            short-wheelbase model, the extended wheelbase model is codenamed G12
            and designated with an additional L letter. The G11/G12 is the first
            car lineup of BMW Group to be based on the modular OKL platform
            (Oberklasse, German for luxury class). The OKL platform adopts
            technology first introduced in BMW i models, namely the introduction
            of carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer as structural chassis components.
